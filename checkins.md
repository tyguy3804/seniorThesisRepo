## Week 1 Summary (09/22/2025)

### This week I worked on:

I mainly have been extracting ERA5 data which I plan on using to train my model on. On Monday I added three use cases to my README.md but I would like to review them to make sure they are good enough.

### This week I learned:

That extracting data from an API takes longer than I expexted. One file takes up to 5 mintutes to extract but that really just means I need to run the extraction program more throughout the week. I also learned that instead of having seperate loops for pressure level and surface level data it would be better to retrieve both data in the same loop.

### My successes this week were:

I have extracted three years of data so far but would like to have more by now. 

### The challenges I faced this week were:

Looping through thirty-five years of data might take longer than I expexted, especially since I have to make two seperate datasets.

## Week 2 Summary (09/29/2025)
### This week I worked on:

Updated my extraction program so that I'm getting surface and pressue data in the same loop. Almost completed my HRRR extraction program. Began working on the MetPy calculations program.

### This week I learned:

How Herbie, an hrrr data extraction python package, works and also how HRRR data looks like. Learned some new regular expressions that Herbie uses to collect the correct data.

### My successes this week were:

I have been extracting more ERA5 data than I have last week and it has been much smoother as well. Not just have I been extracting more ERA5 data, I've gotten my hrrr extraction program up and running and I'm extracting the correct data as well.


### The challenges I faced this week were:

The most challenging part so far was figuring out how HRRR extraction worked and I had to tinker with the process of extacting the days, times, and variables I wanted. For example, getting data on different altitude levels (EX: 2m and 10m) wasn't allowed if I wanted one singular dataset (It would make a list of two seperate datasets). Going along with the struggle with HRRR extraction it took me awhile to create regular expressions that I send into the Herbie object that allows it to get the correct data.
